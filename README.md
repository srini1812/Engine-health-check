This study evaluates six machine learning models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, Gradient Boosting) to predict engine conditions from sensor data. XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (68.50%), with boosting algorithms outperforming LSTM. Findings suggest simpler models can outperform deep learning in this context.
